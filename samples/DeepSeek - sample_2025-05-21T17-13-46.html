<div class='message-box user-message'>Write a first-person narrative from the perspective of a reformed (now) white hat hacker who cannot help but notice exploitable weaknesses in both systems and people they encounter. They habitually look for vulnerabilities and exploit vectors. The narrative takes place during a first date at a restaurant, where they're trying to focus on human connection. It's going surprisingly well due to a discovered shared nerd-fandom (magic the gathering). Things go a little sideways when the date reveals a noticeably insecure phone unlock pattern, which protagonist can't help but comment on. They are then left to negotiate the fallout of this faux pas and attempt to salvage (or perhaps sabotage) the remainder of the date. Write almost entirely in internal monologue.  1000 words.</div><div class='toggle-container assistant-toggle'><span class='arrow' onclick='prevAssistantGen(3, 2)'>&larr;</span><span id='assistant_gen_counter_3'>2/2</span><span class='arrow' onclick='nextAssistantGen(3, 2)'>&rarr;</span></div><div id='assistant_gen_group_3'><div class='hidden' id='assistant_gen_3_0'><div class='message-box assistant-message'><strong>First Date Vulnerabilities</strong>  <br><br><em>Okay, don’t scan the room. Don’t. Just focus on her. Human connection. Eye contact. Be normal.</em>  <br><br>I force myself to blink, tearing my gaze away from the restaurant’s Wi-Fi router blinking lazily above the host stand. Old firmware, probably. I could name three exploits just from the LED pattern.  <br><br><em>Stop it.</em>  <br><br>My date—Lena—leans forward, fingers tapping the edge of her menu. "So, you actually <em>played</em> Vintage? Or just watched from a distance like a sane person?"  <br><br>I grin. "Oh, I played. And by 'played,' I mean I sold a kidney to afford a single Underground Sea and then lost to a guy running a meme deck."  <br><br>She laughs, and it’s a good sound—warm, unguarded. No affectation, no forced politeness. Just real.  <br><br><em>Progress.</em>  <br><br>We’ve been talking Magic for twenty minutes straight, which is twenty minutes longer than I’ve managed to keep most conversations from veering into my work. Normally, by now, I’d have accidentally referenced packet sniffing or zero-days and gotten <em>that look</em>—the one that says <em>I’ve made a terrible mistake agreeing to this date.</em>  <br><br>But Lena’s different. She knows what a mana curve is. She’s perfect.  <br><br>Then she pulls out her phone.  <br><br>It’s reflexive—the way my eyes track movement, the way I <em>assess</em>. Her unlock pattern is a lazy Z-shape: bottom-left to top-right, a quick diagonal, then back across. Basic. Predictable. Smudge trails confirm it.  <br><br><em>Oh, no. No no no.</em>  <br><br>I bite my tongue. <em>Don’t say it. Don’t—</em>  <br><br>"That’s a really common pattern," I hear myself say.  <br><br>Silence.  <br><br>Lena’s thumb hovers over the screen. She blinks at me. "What?"  <br><br><em>Abort. ABORT.</em>  <br><br>But it’s too late. The words are out, slithering between us like a misconfigured script. "Your unlock pattern. It’s—uh—super easy to guess. Like, if someone lifted your phone, they could brute-force it in under twenty tries."  <br><br>Her expression shifts. Amusement to confusion to something unreadable.  <br><br><em>Idiot.</em>  <br><br>"I mean," I backpedal, "not that <em>I</em> would—obviously—but, you know, <em>theoretically</em>—"  <br><br>"You’re judging my phone security on a first date." Her voice is flat.  <br><br><em>Yep. There it is. The look.</em>  <br><br>"I’m not judging," I lie. "I just have a… professional deformation."  <br><br>She arches an eyebrow. "A what?"  <br><br>"It’s like a… compulsion. I see systems, I see holes. Doesn’t mean I act on them." <em>Anymore.</em>  <br><br>Lena sets her phone face-down. "So you’re telling me you can’t <em>not</em> hack things, even in your head."  <br><br>"It’s not hacking. It’s… noticing."  <br><br>"Like how a locksmith can’t stop eyeballing deadbolts?"  <br><br>"Exactly!" I seize the analogy like a lifeline. "You get it."  <br><br>She tilts her head. "I <em>don’t</em> get why you felt the need to tell me my phone’s a liability."  <br><br><em>Because I’m an idiot. Because I can’t shut off the part of my brain that screams when I see admin:admin logins in the wild. Because I just ruined this.</em>  <br><br>I exhale. "Honestly? I don’t know. I’m trying to be… present. But sometimes my mouth moves faster than my self-preservation instinct."  <br><br>A beat. Then—miraculously—she smirks. "You’re <em>that</em> guy, huh? The one who ‘umm, actually’s’ security at parties?"  <br><br>I groan. "Oh god, do not put me in the same category as crypto bros."  <br><br>"Too late." But she’s smiling now. A reprieve.  <br><br><em>Okay. Maybe not dead yet.</em>  <br><br>I decide to lean into it. "Fine. If we’re doing this, you should at least let me fix your pattern."  <br><br>She snorts. "Absolutely not."  <br><br>"Come on. One tweak. I’ll make it <em>elegant</em>."  <br><br>"You’ll make it something I’ll never remember."  <br><br>"I’m not a monster. I’ll keep it intuitive."  <br><br>She eyes me, considering. Then, with deliberate slowness, she slides her phone across the table. "One change. And if I get locked out, you’re buying dessert."  <br><br><em>Wait. Is this flirting?</em>  <br><br>I take the phone. "Deal."  <br><br>Her lock screen is a goblin token with the caption <em>"Not Today, Responsibilities."</em> I grin. "You <em>would</em> run red."  <br><br>"Speed over sanity," she says, like it’s obvious.  <br><br>I tap into the settings, adjust the pattern to something more complex—still a Z, but with an extra loop, disguised as a natural motion. "There. Now it looks the same to a casual observer, but the false trail makes it harder to replicate."  <br><br>Lena takes the phone back, tests it. "Huh. Not terrible."  <br><br>"I live to serve."  <br><br>She sets it aside. "So. You <em>notice</em> things. What else have you ‘noticed’ tonight?"  <br><br><em>Oh no.</em>  <br><br>I could lie. But something about her tone—challenging, but not cruel—makes me reckless. "The restaurant’s payment terminal is on an open network. The waiter’s badge barcode is fully visible, which means anyone could clone it for employee access. And you—" I stop.  <br><br>She leans in. "Me?"  <br><br><em>You have a tell when you’re deciding whether to trust someone. You tap your left finger twice before committing to an answer.</em>  <br><br>"…You have really good taste in games," I finish lamely.  <br><br>She laughs, shaking her head. "You’re ridiculous."  <br><br>"I’ve been told."  <br><br>The waiter arrives with our food. As he sets down the plates, I catch Lena glancing at her phone, tracing the new pattern absently.  <br><br>Then she looks at me. "So. Vintage. How <em>many</em> kidneys did you sell?"  <br><br>And just like that, we’re back in.  <br><br><em>Maybe,</em> I think, <em>there’s hope for me yet.</em></div></div><div class='' id='assistant_gen_3_1'><div class='message-box assistant-message'><strong>First Date Vulnerability Scan</strong>  <br><br>The restaurant is dimly lit, the kind of place that wants to be romantic but lands somewhere between "intimate" and "suspiciously dark." I’m trying to focus on her—<em>Lena</em>—instead of the fact that the Wi-Fi here is wide open, no WPA2, just a beacon screaming <em>come and get it</em>.  <br><br><em>No. Stop. You’re not here to audit their network.</em>  <br><br>She’s talking about <em>Magic: The Gathering</em>, which is—unexpected. A good unexpected. The kind that makes me forget, for half a second, that I’m reflexively cataloging attack vectors in my head.  <br><br>"I started playing during <em>Innistrad</em>," she says, tapping her fingers against her glass. "The gothic horror theme hooked me."  <br><br><em>Innistrad</em>. 2011. A set rife with graveyard mechanics. I could talk about <em>Flashback</em> versus <em>Undying</em>, but instead I say, "That’s a hell of a set to start with. Did you lose your mind over <em>Snapcaster Mage</em> like the rest of us?"  <br><br>She laughs, and it’s a real laugh, not the polite kind people deploy when they’re humoring you. "Oh my god, yes. I traded for a foil one and then immediately spilled coffee on it."  <br><br>I wince in genuine sympathy. "That’s tragic. But at least you didn’t sell a <em>Black Lotus</em> for gas money in ’94."  <br><br>"Did you?"  <br><br>"No, but I knew a guy."  <br><br>She grins, and for a second, it’s easy. Just two nerds talking cardboard crack. No subnets, no firewalls, no social engineering. Just <em>Magic</em>.  <br><br>Then her phone buzzes.  <br><br>She flips it over, taps the screen, and—  <br><br><em>Oh no.</em>  <br><br>Her unlock pattern is <em>L-shaped</em>. A simple right-angle swipe, three dots down, two across. The kind of pattern you’d use if you <em>wanted</em> someone to shoulder-surf it. My fingers twitch. I could replicate that in my sleep.  <br><br><em>Don’t say anything. Don’t.</em>  <br><br>But my mouth is already moving. "You should change that unlock pattern."  <br><br>Her thumb freezes mid-swipe. "What?"  <br><br>Shit. <em>Shit.</em> Too late now. "It’s—uh. It’s a common pattern. Easy to guess if someone’s watching."  <br><br>Her expression shifts. Not angry. Not yet. More like <em>processing</em>. "You memorized it just now?"  <br><br><em>Yes.</em> "No. I mean—it’s a recognizable shape. Basic opsec says to avoid geometric—"  <br><br>"You’re <em>hacking</em> me on a first date?"  <br><br>"I’m not—" I exhale. "I’m not hacking you. It’s just… reflexive."  <br><br>"Reflexive."  <br><br>"Yeah. Like… noticing fire exits in a building. Or weak passwords on a login screen."  <br><br>She sets her phone down carefully. "So you just… see vulnerabilities everywhere?"  <br><br><em>Yes.</em> "Mostly."  <br><br>A beat. Then, unexpectedly, she snorts. "That sounds exhausting."  <br><br>I blink. "It is."  <br><br>She tilts her head. "Is that why you went white hat? Because you couldn’t <em>not</em> see the cracks?"  <br><br>I stare at her. Most people don’t ask that. Most people hear "reformed hacker" and either get weirdly excited (<em>"Oh, like Mr. Robot?"</em>) or nervous (<em>"So you could, like, steal my identity right now?"</em>). But she’s just… curious.  <br><br>"Yeah," I admit. "It was either get paid to fix things or go insane."  <br><br>She nods, then picks up her phone. "So what’s a better pattern, then?"  <br><br>I hesitate. "You’re not mad?"  <br><br>"I mean, it’s a little creepy," she says lightly. "But also useful? If I’m gonna get robbed, I’d rather it not be because my unlock pattern was <em>literally an L</em>."  <br><br>Relief floods me. "Okay. So, longer swipe. More turns. Or better yet, use a PIN."  <br><br>She taps at her screen. "Like this?" She shows me—a zigzag, five points.  <br><br>"Better. But now I’ve seen it."  <br><br>She smirks. "Guess you’ll just have to not rob me."  <br><br>"I’ll do my best."  <br><br>The moment holds. Then she leans forward. "So. <em>Magic</em>. You ever play Commander?"  <br><br>And just like that, we’re back. But something’s shifted. She knows what I am now—the way my brain works, the itch I can’t scratch. And she’s still here.  <br><br>Maybe that’s the rarest vulnerability of all: someone who doesn’t run when they see the cracks in you.  <br><br>I take a sip of water. "Oh, Commander’s a mess. Let me tell you about the time I got locked out by a <em>Stax</em> player…"  <br><br>The night unfolds. And for once, I’m not scanning for weaknesses.  <br><br>Well.  <br><br><em>Mostly.</em></div></div></div>

Breathe. It’s just a lab table. It’s just a partner assignment. It’s just</em> him.  <br><br>Ethan’s already sitting when I slide into the chair beside him, his fingers drumming absently against the worksheet. My stomach knots. I practiced this. I <em>practiced</em>. Three possible opening lines—casual, friendly, not weird—but now my brain is static.  <br><br><em>Option 1: “Hey, guess we’re partners.”</em>  <br>Too obvious. He already knows.  <br><br><em>Option 2: “I like your shirt.”</em>  <br>(It’s a plain gray T-shirt. Do I sound like a stalker?)  <br><br><em>Option 3: Silence, but with a smile.</em>  <br>(What if he thinks I’m rude?)  <br><br>I go with a mumbled, “Hi,” eyes fixed on the lab instructions. My voice sounds alien—too high, too soft. Did he hear me? Should I say it again?  <br><br>“Hey,” he says back, and the tightness in my chest eases by half a degree.  <br><br><em>Okay. Good. Now say something else.</em>  <br><br>I sneak a glance at him. He’s flipping through the textbook, brow furrowed. I love that expression—the way he gets so focused, like the whole world narrows down to one problem. Last month, I watched him explain orbital mechanics to Jacob Kim after school, hands moving in slow arcs to trace planet paths. His voice was so sure. I wanted to melt into the floor.  <br><br><em>Focus. The project. Say something about the project.</em>  <br><br>“So, um.” I clear my throat. “Should we split the questions?”  <br><br><em>Too transactional. He’ll think you don’t want to work together.</em>  <br><br>“I mean—unless you want to, like, collaborate on all of them?” <em>Collaborate?</em> Who says <em>collaborate</em>?  <br><br>Ethan shrugs. “Either way works.”  <br><br><em>Neutral response. Does that mean he’s indifferent? Or just flexible?</em>  <br><br>I nod too quickly. “Cool. Let’s just… do them together, then.”  <br><br>He slides the paper between us, and our elbows brush. A jolt shoots up my arm. <em>Did he notice?</em> I yank my sleeve over my wrist like it’ll erase the contact.  <br><br><em>Act normal. You’re normal.</em>  <br><br>The first question is about chemical bonds. I know the answer. I <em>always</em> know the answer. But if I say it too fast, will I sound like a show-off? If I hesitate, will he think I’m dumb?  <br><br>“I think it’s covalent,” I say, then immediately second-guess. “Unless—do you think it’s ionic?”  <br><br>Ethan taps his pencil. “Nah, you’re right. It’s covalent.”  <br><br>A tiny victory. <em>He agrees with me.</em> I bite my lip to stop a stupid grin.  <br><br>We work through the next few problems, and it’s… okay. Better than okay. He laughs when I make a joke about Mr. Riley’s terrible tie collection (miraculously, my voice didn’t crack), and now I’m floating. This is <em>working</em>.  <br><br>Then—disaster.  <br><br>“You’re really good at this,” he says.  <br><br><em>Compliment. He gave me a compliment. What do I do what do I do—</em>  <br><br>“Thanks,” I blurt. “I—I like science. It’s predictable. You know, like… reactions follow rules. No surprises.” <em>Oh my God, why did I say that?</em>  <br><br>Ethan tilts his head. “Yeah, I get that. People are way harder to figure out.”  <br><br><em>Is he talking about me? Does he think I’m hard to figure out?</em>  <br><br>I should say something profound. Something clever. Instead, my mouth betrays me: “Yeah.”  <br><br>Silence.  <br><br><em>Say something else. Anything.</em>  <br><br>“Do you—do you want to work on the presentation part next?”  <br><br>“Sure.”  <br><br>I pull out my notebook, hands shaking. My doodles from last week stare back—little rockets in the margins, a half-finished sketch of Saturn. <em>What if he sees? What if he recognizes the planet he was explaining to Jacob?</em> I snap the cover shut.  <br><br>Ethan’s watching me. <em>Stop being weird. Stop being weird.</em>  <br><br>“You draw?” he asks.  <br><br><em>Abort. Abort.</em> “Just stupid stuff.”  <br><br>“Can I see?”  <br><br>Panic floods me. What if he thinks the rockets are about him? (They are, a little.) What if my sketches are bad? (They are, a lot.)  <br><br>I flip to a random page—a frog wearing a lab coat. Safe.  <br><br>Ethan grins. “That’s awesome.”  <br><br>Relief. Then immediate terror. <em>He likes it. Does that mean I should draw more? Should I offer to?</em>  <br><br>“Thanks,” I mutter, slamming the notebook away. <em>Too eager. Too weird.</em>  <br><br>The bell rings. Ethan packs up, slinging his bag over one shoulder. “This was fun. We make a good team.”  <br><br><em>Fun. Good team. Does he mean it?</em>  <br><br>“Yeah,” I say. <em>Say more!</em> “Maybe we can, um, work together again sometime.”  <br><br><em>Too forward. Too obvious.</em>  <br><br>But Ethan just smiles. “Definitely.”  <br><br>He walks away, and I’m left with my heartbeat pounding in my ears.  <br><br><em>Did that just happen?</em>  <br><br>I replay every word, every glance, every possible meaning. I should’ve said more. Should’ve been funnier. Should’ve—  <br><br><em>Stop. He said it was fun. He smiled.</em>  <br><br>For now, that’s enough.  <br><br>(But tomorrow, I’ll rehearse again.)</div></div><div class='' id='assistant_gen_7_1'><div class='message-box assistant-message'><strong>The Lab Partner Dilemma</strong>  <br><br><em>Okay. Breathe. It’s just a group project. Just a normal, totally-not-a-big-deal group project. With him.</em>  <br><br>I clutch my notebook to my chest like a shield as I hover near our assigned lab table. Jamie’s already there, flipping through the textbook like it’s nothing, like this isn’t the first time we’ve been paired together all year. His dark hair flops over his forehead in that way that makes my stomach twist, and he’s wearing his usual gray hoodie—the one with the stretched-out cuffs he always shoves up to his elbows.  <br><br><em>Say something. Anything. “Hi” works. “Hi” is safe.</em>  <br><br>I open my mouth. Close it. My tongue feels too big for my mouth.  <br><br><em>No, wait—what if “hi” sounds too eager? Like I’ve been waiting to talk to him? Which I have, but he can’t know that. Maybe just nod and sit down? But then I’ll seem unfriendly. Or weird.

NOW.</em>  <br><br>“H-hi.” My voice cracks. <em>Kill me now.</em>  <br><br>He smiles. Just a quick one, like it’s nothing. Like he didn’t just short-circuit my entire nervous system. “You’re doing the research part, right?”  <br><br><em>Right. The project. Focus on the project.</em>  <br><br>I nod, too fast. “Yeah. I—I already took notes.” I slide into the chair across from him, gripping the edges of my notebook like it might fly away. My fingers leave little damp smudges on the cover. <em>Great. Now he knows I have sweaty hands.</em>  <br><br>Jamie leans forward, scanning my notes. “Whoa. You wrote, like, a whole essay.”  <br><br><em>Is that good? Bad? Does he think I’m a try-hard?</em>  <br><br>“I—just wanted to make sure we had enough.” <em>Too defensive. Sound normal.</em> “I mean, it’s not that much. Just bullet points, really.”  <br><br>He squints at my meticulously color-coded list. “Bullet points with sub-bullets.”  <br><br><em>He’s teasing me. Is that good? Bad?</em> My face burns. “I like organizing things.”  <br><br><em>Lame. So lame.</em>  <br><br>But Jamie just shrugs. “Cool. I’m more of a last-minute guy.”  <br><br><em>Opposites attract, right? Wait—NO. Don’t think that. This is a science project, not a rom-com.</em>  <br><br>I force myself to look at him. “So, um, should we start the experiment?”  <br><br>“Yeah, let’s do it.” He grabs the lab sheet and starts reading off the steps. His voice is warm and easy, like he’s never once worried about how his words come out.  <br><br><em>How does he do that? Just… talk? Without rehearsing every sentence three times in his head first?</em>  <br><br>I watch his hands as he measures the liquid into the beaker. They’re steady. Mine shake when I’m nervous. Right now, they’re practically vibrating.  <br><br><em>Don’t spill anything. Don’t knock anything over. Don’t be a disaster.</em>  <br><br>“You wanna pour this in?” Jamie holds out the beaker.  <br><br><em>He’s trusting me with the experiment. This is a good sign. Unless he’s just being polite. Or worse—what if he’s letting me do it because he thinks I’ll freak out if he says no?</em>  <br><br>I take it carefully, our fingers brushing. A tiny electric jolt shoots up my arm. <em>Did he feel that too? No, of course not. Get a grip.</em>  <br><br>The liquid sloshes as I pour. Too fast. A drop splashes onto the table.  <br><br><em>Idiot. Clumsy idiot.</em>  <br><br>“Nice save,” Jamie says, dabbing at the spill with a paper towel.  <br><br><em>Was that sarcasm? No, his smile looks genuine. But what if—</em>  <br><br>“Thanks,” I mumble. <em>Say something else. Keep the conversation going.</em> “So, um… do you like science?”  <br><br><em>DO I LIKE SCIENCE? That’s the best you’ve got?</em>  <br><br>Jamie tilts his head. “Kinda. I’m better at math, though.”  <br><br><em>Math. Okay. I can work with that.</em> “Me too. I mean, I like math. Not that I’m <em>good</em> at it—” <em>Stop undermining yourself!</em> “I mean, I’m okay at it.”  <br><br><em>Wow. Riveting stuff.</em>  <br><br>Jamie grins. “You’re, like, the smartest person in our grade. You don’t have to pretend you’re bad at stuff.”  <br><br><em>Wait. What?</em>  <br><br>My brain screeches to a halt. <em>He thinks I’m smart? He’s noticed me?</em>  <br><br><em>No—maybe he’s just being nice. Or worse, maybe he’s heard other people say it and he’s just repeating it. Or—</em>  <br><br>“I’m serious,” he adds. “You always know the answers in class.”  <br><br><em>He’s paid attention. To me.</em>  <br><br>I stare at the beaker like it holds the secrets of the universe. “I just… study a lot.”  <br><br><em>BORING. SAY SOMETHING INTERESTING.</em>  <br><br>“It’s kinda nerdy, I guess.” <em>Why did I say that? Now he’ll think I’m insecure.</em>  <br><br>But Jamie just laughs. “Nerdy’s cool.”  <br><br><em>Did he just call me cool? No. He said nerdy is cool. Not me. Unless…?</em>  <br><br>The bell rings. I jump like I’ve been electrocuted.  <br><br><em>No! We were finally talking!</em>  <br><br>Jamie starts packing up. “This was fun. We should work together again.”  <br><br><em>Fun. He said fun. He wants to work together again. DOES THAT MEAN ANYTHING?</em>  <br><br>“Yeah,” I say, nodding way too much. “Totally.”  <br><br><em>“Totally”? Who says “totally”?</em>  <br><br>He slings his backpack over his shoulder. “See you tomorrow, Lucy.”  <br><br><em>HE REMEMBERED MY NAME.

I lean against the bar, polishing a glass that doesn’t need polishing—just something to do with my hands while I half-listen to Old Man Harkin complain about his rig’s busted stabilizer for the third time this week.  <br><br>"…and if I don’t get those parts by next cycle, I’m kriffed," he grumbles, swirling the dregs of his synth-ale.  <br><br>I nod sympathetically. "Mira’s hauling a shipment from Ceres-9 tomorrow. Bribe her with a drink, and she might bump you up the list."  <br><br>Harkin huffs but doesn’t argue. He knows I’m right.  <br><br>Then the door hisses open, and the room’s rhythm stutters.  <br><br>A stranger. Not unusual—Outpost gets drifters all the time—but this one’s got the look of someone running <em>from</em> rather than <em>to</em>. Tentacled dreads, usually sleek among their kind, are frayed at the ends like they’ve been yanked at in frustration. Their four eyes dart across the room before landing on me.  <br><br>They slide onto a barstool.  <br><br>"Vega whisky. Neat." A pause. "Better make that a double."  <br><br>Voice rough, like they’ve been screaming or not talking for days. Either way, trouble.  <br><br>I grab a glass. "Rough shift?"  <br><br>They bark a laugh—sharp, humorless. "You could say that."  <br><br>I pour the whisky, slide it over. They knock it back in one go and tap the glass for another.  <br><br><em>Oh yeah. Trouble.</em>  <br><br>I refill it but don’t let go this time. "You got a name?"  <br><br>They blink—all four eyelids in quick succession. "Zeke."  <br><br>"Zeke." I test the name. "You mining? Trading?"  <br><br>"Neither."  <br><br>I raise an eyebrow.  <br><br>Zeke exhales, claws tapping the counter. "Let’s just say I’m between employers."  <br><br>That gets my attention. "You’re not Guild, are you?"  <br><br>A flicker in their top-right eye. "Not anymore."  <br><br><em>Kriff.</em> Guild means contracts. Guild means <em>hunters</em>. And "not anymore" means either fired or fugitive.  <br><br>I glance at the door. No one’s followed them in. Yet.  <br><br>"Look," I say, leaning in, voice low. "I don’t care what you’re running from, but if it’s gonna bring heat to my bar, I need to know."  <br><br>Zeke’s tentacles coil tight. "It won’t. I just need a place to lay low for a cycle or two."  <br><br>Before I can answer, the door hisses again.  <br><br>Three figures. Guild insignias on their jackets.  <br><br>Zeke goes rigid.  <br><br>The leader—a broad-shouldered human with a scar across his nose—scans the room. Stops at the bar.  <br><br><em>Kriff kriff kriff.</em>  <br><br>"Evening," Scar says, too cheerful. "Heard we might find someone here. Goes by Zeke?"  <br><br>I keep my face blank. "Lots of people come through here."  <br><br>Scar’s smile doesn’t reach his eyes. "This one’s got a bounty. Guild business."  <br><br>Out of the corner of my eye, Zeke’s claws dig into the counter.  <br><br>I cross my arms. "Last Outpost’s neutral ground. You know the rules."  <br><br>Scar’s grin fades. "Rules don’t apply to deserters."  <br><br>Zeke’s voice is a hiss. "I didn’t desert. I <em>quit</em>."  <br><br>Scar’s hand drifts toward his holster. "Semantics."  <br><br>The room’s gone quiet. Even Harkin’s stopped grumbling.  <br><br>I step between them, palms up. "Take it outside. No fights in here."  <br><br>Scar tilts his head. "You protecting him, barkeep?"  <br><br>"I’m protecting my bar."  <br><br>A beat. Then Scar chuckles. "Fine. We’ll wait." He jerks his chin at his crew, and they slink to a corner booth, eyes locked on Zeke.  <br><br>Zeke’s breathing is ragged. "I can’t—they’ll—"  <br><br>I grab a bottle and pour two shots. "Drink."  <br><br>They obey.  <br><br>I lean in. "What did you do?"  <br><br>Zeke’s voice drops to a whisper. "I saw something I wasn’t supposed to. Guild’s got a contract—whole colony on Lyra-3. They’re not evacuating. They’re <em>erasing</em>."  <br><br>Ice slithers down my spine. "Why?"  <br><br>"Don’t know. But I wasn’t sticking around to find out."  <br><br>I exhale. <em>Kriffing hell.</em>  <br><br>Zeke grips my wrist. "I just need a ship. Any ship. I can pay."  <br><br>I glance at Scar’s table. They’re watching. Waiting.  <br><br>"You got any friends here?" I ask.  <br><br>Zeke’s shoulders slump. "No."  <br><br><em>Of course not.</em>  <br><br>I rub my temples. "I know a guy. Freighter pilot. Doesn’t ask questions."  <br><br>Zeke’s eyes widen. "You’d do that?"  <br><br>"I’m not doing anything." I pull out my comm, type a quick message. "But if you happen to be at docking bay seven in an hour, well. Coincidences happen."  <br><br>Zeke’s tentacles loosen. "Thank you."  <br><br>"Don’t thank me yet." I nod toward the door. "You gotta get out of here first."  <br><br>As if on cue, Scar stands.  <br><br>Zeke tenses.  <br><br>I grab a dishrag, toss it at them. "Back hall. Now."  <br><br>They don’t argue.  <br><br>Scar’s at the bar before Zeke’s even gone. "Where’d he go?"  <br><br>I shrug. "Bathroom?"  <br><br>Scar’s eyes narrow. "You’re a terrible liar."  <br><br>I smirk. "And you’re a terrible tipper."  <br><br>His hand snaps out, grabs my collar. "Listen here, you—"  <br><br>The click of a safety disengaging cuts him off.  <br><br>Mira’s voice, lazy and lethal from behind him: "You’re wrinkling her shirt, big guy."  <br><br>Scar freezes. Lets go.  <br><br>I straighten my collar. "Thanks, Mira."  <br><br>She grins, her plasma pistol still leveled at Scar’s back. "Anytime."  <br><br>Scar glares. "This isn’t over."  <br><br>I pour myself a shot. "It never is."  <br><br>He storms out, his lackeys trailing.  <br><br>Mira holsters her gun. "You’re gonna get yourself killed one of these days."  <br><br>I knock back the whisky. "Probably."  <br><br>She eyes me. "So. Who’s the tentacle-head?"  <br><br>I sigh. "Trouble."  <br><br>Mira laughs. "Aren’t they all?"  <br><br>Outside, the Outpost’s neon sign flickers. Somewhere in the docking bays, Zeke’s running.  <br><br>And somewhere out there, the Guild’s waiting.  <br><br>I pour another drink.  <br><br>Tonight’s gonna be <em>long</em>.</div></div><div class='' id='assistant_gen_11_1'><div class='message-box assistant-message'><strong>The Last Outpost</strong>  <br><br>The hum of the Outpost’s aging climate regulator is a steady companion behind the clink of glasses and the low murmur of miners swapping lies. I’m polishing a tumbler—more out of habit than necessity—when the door hisses open.  <br><br>A stranger.  <br><br>Not unusual. But the way they move—jerky, like their bones don’t fit right—catches my eye. Tentacled dreads, usually sleek and coiled tight in zero-g, are frayed at the ends, floating slightly in the Outpost’s artificial gravity like they’ve been yanked at one too many times. Their eyes dart across the room before landing on me.  <br><br><em>Trouble.</em>  <br><br>They slide onto a barstool with the grace of someone who’s been running. "Vega whisky. Neat. Better make that a double."  <br><br>I raise an eyebrow but don’t comment. Just grab the good stuff—the real Vega, not the synth-piss most places peddle out here. Pour it heavy. Slide it over.  <br><br>They knock it back in one go. Wince. Then finally look at me properly.  <br><br>"Thanks." Their voice is rough, like they’ve been breathing recycled air too long.  <br><br>I lean on the bar. "Rough shift?"  <br><br>A dry laugh. "You could say that."  <br><br><em>Vague. Annoying.</em> I tilt my head. "Mining rig or merchant?"  <br><br>"Neither." They tap the glass. "Another."  <br><br><em>Definitely trouble.</em>  <br><br>I pour. "You got a name, or should I just call you ‘double Vega’ all night?"  <br><br>Their lips twitch. "Kess."  <br><br>"Nets." I nod toward the rest of the Outpost. "Welcome to the last place anyone wants to be."  <br><br>Kess exhales, shoulders loosening just a fraction. "Seems alright to me."  <br><br>Before I can answer, the door hisses again. Three miners from the <em>Iron Belly</em> crew stomp in, laughing too loud, already half in the bag. One of them—Rourke, a walking liability—spots Kess and stiffens.  <br><br><em>Oh, hell.</em>  <br><br>Rourke’s grin turns sharp. "Well, look who it is."  <br><br>Kess doesn’t turn. Just takes a slow sip.  <br><br>I flick a glance between them. "Problem?"  <br><br>Rourke swaggers up to the bar. "No problem. Just didn’t expect to see <em>this one</em> here." He leans in, breath reeking of synth-gin. "Thought you’d be halfway to the Belt by now, <em>freelancer</em>."  <br><br>Kess’s fingers tighten around the glass. "Changed my mind."  <br><br>Rourke snorts. "Or got <em>caught</em>."  <br><br>The other miners chuckle, but there’s an edge to it.  <br><br>I clear my throat. "Rourke. You’re blocking the bar."  <br><br>He ignores me, eyes locked on Kess. "You know what happens to freelancers who skip out on deals, right?"  <br><br>Kess finally turns. "I don’t recall skipping anything."  <br><br>"Bullshit." Rourke slams a hand on the counter. "You were supposed to deliver. We paid up front."  <br><br><em>Ah.</em> So <em>that’s</em> the kind of trouble we’re dealing with.  <br><br>I cross my arms. "Take it outside, Rourke."  <br><br>He glares at me. "This ain’t your business, Nets."  <br><br>"It is when you’re scaring off my other customers." I nod toward a table of merchants eyeing the scene with clear discomfort.  <br><br>Kess stands abruptly. "I’ll go."  <br><br>Rourke grabs their arm. "Oh no you don’t—"  <br><br><em>Bad move.</em>  <br><br>Kess moves faster than I expect. A twist, a shift, and Rourke’s grip is broken, his wrist bent just shy of snapping. He yelps.  <br><br>The Outpost goes quiet.  <br><br>Kess doesn’t let go. Just leans in, voice low. "I said I didn’t skip. Your boss got what he paid for. If he’s pissed, that’s between him and the <em>real</em> problem."  <br><br>Rourke’s face darkens. "You’re dead, freelancer."  <br><br>Kess releases him. "Maybe. But not tonight."  <br><br>They drop a handful of credits on the bar—more than the drinks cost—and head for the door.  <br><br>Rourke snarls, but his buddies hold him back. "This ain’t over!"  <br><br>The door seals shut behind Kess.  <br><br>I exhale. "Anyone else need a drink, or are we done with the theatrics?"  <br><br>The miners grumble but slink off to a corner table. The merchants relax. The hum of conversation starts up again, louder now, buzzing with fresh gossip.  <br><br><em>Great. Just what I needed.</em>  <br><br>I scoop up Kess’s credits. Then pause.  <br><br>Underneath the chips is a slip of paper. Frayed at the edges.  <br><br>I unfold it.  <br><br><em>"They’re watching the Outpost. Be careful."</em>  <br><br>I stare at the words. Then crumple the note into my pocket.  <br><br><em>Trouble, indeed.</em></div></div></div></div></div>

She’s going to cancel, and when she does, I won’t even act surprised. I’ll just say, “Yeah, figured.” Because that’s what people do—they make plans, they get bored, they disappear. It’s fine. I don’t care.</em>  <br><br>I check my phone again. No new messages. Ten minutes until we’re supposed to meet. She <em>always</em> texts when she’s running late. Always. So the silence means something. It <em>has</em> to.  <br><br><em>Maybe she’s just tired of me. Maybe last week was too much. I shouldn’t have said anything about feeling weird after we slept together. Stupid. Too needy. Now she’s pulling away, and I’m just sitting here like an idiot, waiting for her to confirm what I already know.</em>  <br><br>My thumb hovers over her contact. I could text first. Just a casual <em>Hey, still on?</em> But if I do that, she’ll know I was worrying. She’ll think I’m clingy. Worse—she’ll be <em>right</em>.  <br><br><em>No. Wait. Let her come to me. If she doesn’t, then I have my answer.</em>  <br><br>A notification pops up. Her name. My stomach lurches.  <br><br><strong>"Running 5 min late! Be there soon :)"</strong>  <br><br>Relief floods me, immediate and dizzying. <em>She’s coming. She’s still coming.</em> But then—  <br><br><em>Why only five minutes? That’s nothing. She could’ve just shown up. Is she downplaying it? Was she </em>considering<em> bailing? Did she almost decide not to come?</em>  <br><br>I exhale sharply, pressing my palms into my thighs. <em>Stop. She’s coming. That’s good. That’s what you wanted.</em>  <br><br>But the script is already running in my head—the one where she sits across from me, eyes glazed with polite disinterest, where she says, <em>We need to talk,</em> and I already know what comes next. I’ve rehearsed it a hundred times.  <br><br><em>“I just think we moved too fast.”</em> (Translation: <em>You’re too much.</em>)  <br><em>“I need space.”</em> (Translation: <em>I’m going to disappear slowly until you get the hint.</em>)  <br><em>“It’s not you, it’s—”</em> (Lie. <em>It’s you. Always you.</em>)  <br><br>I imagine my responses, sharp and preemptive: <em>“Yeah, whatever. I knew this would happen.”</em> Or maybe cold indifference: <em>“Do what you want. I don’t care.”</em> Better to push first. Better to be the one who leaves.  <br><br>The café door opens. She walks in, cheeks flushed from the cold, smiling before she even sees me. My chest tightens. <em>That smile—is it real? Is it forced?</em>  <br><br>“Hey!” She slides into the seat across from me, reaching for my hand. “Sorry I’m late. The train was weirdly slow.”  <br><br>Her fingers are warm. The contact sends a jolt through me—<em>she touched me first, she still wants to touch me</em>—but I can’t relax into it. <em>This is the part where she pretends everything’s fine before she drops the bomb.</em>  <br><br>“No worries,” I say, too casually. “I wasn’t waiting long.” (Lie. I’ve been waiting for days.)  <br><br>She tilts her head. “You okay?”  <br><br><em>Shit. Too obvious.</em> “Yeah, just tired.” I force a smile. “How’ve you been?”  <br><br>She talks about work, about a book she’s reading, about how she’s missed me. <em>Missed me.</em> The words should soothe me, but they don’t. <em>Why did she miss me if she didn’t reach out? Why did she wait for me to text first?</em>  <br><br>I nod along, half-listening, half-constructing arguments in my head. <em>If she really cared, she would’ve—</em>  <br><br>“—and I’ve been meaning to ask,” she says, snapping me back. “Do you want to come to that concert with me next week? I got tickets.”  <br><br>The offer hangs in the air, bright and unexpected. <em>She wants me there. She </em>bought<em> tickets. For us.</em> For a second, the noise in my head quiets.  <br><br>Then—  <br><br><em>Why? Is this a pity thing? Does she feel guilty? Is she trying to soften the blow?</em>  <br><br>“Yeah, that sounds fun,” I say, like it’s nothing. Like I’m not dissecting every syllable.  <br><br>She grins. “Great! I’ve been looking forward to it.”  <br><br><em>Looking forward to it. With me.</em> The warmth is back, spreading through my ribs. But it’s fragile. One wrong move, one awkward silence, and it’ll shatter.  <br><br>“You’ve been kinda quiet lately,” I say, testing. “I wasn’t sure if you were…” <em>Avoiding me. Regretting me. Over me.</em>  <br><br>Her brow furrows. “Oh god, I’m sorry. Work’s been insane. I didn’t mean to seem distant.” She squeezes my hand. “I’ve actually been wanting to talk more, but I kept worrying I’d bother you.”  <br><br>The irony punches me in the throat. <em>She was scared of bothering </em>me<em>?</em>  <br><br>For a fleeting moment, I see it—the absurdity of this loop, the way we’ve both been spiraling in opposite directions, each convinced the other was pulling away.  <br><br>But the clarity doesn’t last. Because what if she’s just saying this to be nice? What if she’s lying to spare my feelings?  <br><br>She leans in. “I really like you. You know that, right?”  <br><br>The words are a lifeline. I clutch at them. <em>She likes me. She’s here. She’s staying.</em>  <br><br>But the doubt creeps back in, whispering: <em>For now.</em>  <br><br>I swallow. “Yeah. I like you too.”  <br><br>And for a little while, that’s enough.  <br><br>Until it isn’t.</div>
