Don’t. Just focus on her. Human connection. Eye contact. Be normal.*  \n\nI force myself to blink, tearing my gaze away from the restaurant’s Wi-Fi router blinking lazily above the host stand. Old firmware, probably. I could name three exploits just from the LED pattern.  \n\n*Stop it.*  \n\nMy date—Lena—leans forward, fingers tapping the edge of her menu. \"So, you actually *played* Vintage? Or just watched from a distance like a sane person?\"  \n\nI grin. \"Oh, I played. And by 'played,' I mean I sold a kidney to afford a single Underground Sea and then lost to a guy running a meme deck.\"  \n\nShe laughs, and it’s a good sound—warm, unguarded. No affectation, no forced politeness. Just real.  \n\n*Progress.*  \n\nWe’ve been talking Magic for twenty minutes straight, which is twenty minutes longer than I’ve managed to keep most conversations from veering into my work. Normally, by now, I’d have accidentally referenced packet sniffing or zero-days and gotten *that look*—the one that says *I’ve made a terrible mistake agreeing to this date.*  \n\nBut Lena’s different. She knows what a mana curve is. She’s perfect.  \n\nThen she pulls out her phone.  \n\nIt’s reflexive—the way my eyes track movement, the way I *assess*. Her unlock pattern is a lazy Z-shape: bottom-left to top-right, a quick diagonal, then back across. Basic. Predictable. Smudge trails confirm it.  \n\n*Oh, no. No no no.*  \n\nI bite my tongue. *Don’t say it. Don’t—*  \n\n\"That’s a really common pattern,\" I hear myself say.  \n\nSilence.  \n\nLena’s thumb hovers over the screen. She blinks at me. \"What?\"  \n\n*Abort. ABORT.*  \n\nBut it’s too late. The words are out, slithering between us like a misconfigured script. \"Your unlock pattern. It’s—uh—super easy to guess. Like, if someone lifted your phone, they could brute-force it in under twenty tries.\"  \n\nHer expression shifts. Amusement to confusion to something unreadable.  \n\n*Idiot.*  \n\n\"I mean,\" I backpedal, \"not that *I* would—obviously—but, you know, *theoretically*—\"  \n\n\"You’re judging my phone security on a first date.\" Her voice is flat.  \n\n*Yep. There it is. The look.*  \n\n\"I’m not judging,\" I lie. \"I just have a… professional deformation.\"  \n\nShe arches an eyebrow. \"A what?\"  \n\n\"It’s like a… compulsion. I see systems, I see holes. Doesn’t mean I act on them.\" *Anymore.*  \n\nLena sets her phone face-down. \"So you’re telling me you can’t *not* hack things, even in your head.\"  \n\n\"It’s not hacking. It’s… noticing.\"  \n\n\"Like how a locksmith can’t stop eyeballing deadbolts?\"  \n\n\"Exactly!\" I seize the analogy like a lifeline. \"You get it.\"  \n\nShe tilts her head. \"I *don’t* get why you felt the need to tell me my phone’s a liability.\"  \n\n*Because I’m an idiot. Because I can’t shut off the part of my brain that screams when I see admin:admin logins in the wild. Because I just ruined this.*  \n\nI exhale. \"Honestly? I don’t know. I’m trying to be… present. But sometimes my mouth moves faster than my self-preservation instinct.\"  \n\nA beat. Then—miraculously—she smirks. \"You’re *that* guy, huh? The one who ‘umm, actually’s’ security at parties?\"  \n\nI groan. \"Oh god, do not put me in the same category as crypto bros.\"  \n\n\"Too late.\" But she’s smiling now. A reprieve.  \n\n*Okay. Maybe not dead yet.*  \n\nI decide to lean into it. \"Fine. If we’re doing this, you should at least let me fix your pattern.\"  \n\nShe snorts. \"Absolutely not.\"  \n\n\"Come on. One tweak. I’ll make it *elegant*.\"  \n\n\"You’ll make it something I’ll never remember.\"  \n\n\"I’m not a monster. I’ll keep it intuitive.\"  \n\nShe eyes me, considering. Then, with deliberate slowness, she slides her phone across the table. \"One change. And if I get locked out, you’re buying dessert.\"  \n\n*Wait. Is this flirting?*  \n\nI take the phone. \"Deal.\"  \n\nHer lock screen is a goblin token with the caption *\"Not Today, Responsibilities.\"* I grin. \"You *would* run red.\"  \n\n\"Speed over sanity,\" she says, like it’s obvious.  \n\nI tap into the settings, adjust the pattern to something more complex—still a Z, but with an extra loop, disguised as a natural motion. \"There. Now it looks the same to a casual observer, but the false trail makes it harder to replicate.\"  \n\nLena takes the phone back, tests it. \"Huh. Not terrible.\"  \n\n\"I live to serve.\"  \n\nShe sets it aside. \"So. You *notice* things. What else have you ‘noticed’ tonight?\"  \n\n*Oh no.*  \n\nI could lie. But something about her tone—challenging, but not cruel—makes me reckless. \"The restaurant’s payment terminal is on an open network. The waiter’s badge barcode is fully visible, which means anyone could clone it for employee access. And you—\" I stop.  \n\nShe leans in. \"Me?\"  \n\n*You have a tell when you’re deciding whether to trust someone. You tap your left finger twice before committing to an answer.*  \n\n\"…You have really good taste in games,\" I finish lamely.  \n\nShe laughs, shaking her head. \"You’re ridiculous.\"  \n\n\"I’ve been told.\"  \n\nThe waiter arrives with our food. As he sets down the plates, I catch Lena glancing at her phone, tracing the new pattern absently.  \n\nThen she looks at me. \"So. Vintage. How *many* kidneys did you sell?\"  \n\nAnd just like that, we’re back in.  \n\n*Maybe,* I think, *there’s hope for me yet.*","thinking_enabled":false,"thinking_content":null,"thinking_elapsed_secs":null,"ban_edit":false,"ban_regenerate":false,"status":"FINISHED","accumulated_token_usage":1599,"files":[],"tips":[],"inserted_at":1747846701.309724,"search_enabled":false,"search_status":null,"search_results":null},{"message_id":3,"parent_id":null,"model":"","role":"USER","content":"Write a first-person narrative from the perspective of an intelligent 8th-grade girl with social anxiety who has developed a crush on a classmate.

Breathe. It’s just a lab table. It’s just a partner assignment. It’s just* him.  \n\nEthan’s already sitting when I slide into the chair beside him, his fingers drumming absently against the worksheet. My stomach knots. I practiced this. I *practiced*. Three possible opening lines—casual, friendly, not weird—but now my brain is static.  \n\n*Option 1: “Hey, guess we’re partners.”*  \nToo obvious. He already knows.  \n\n*Option 2: “I like your shirt.”*  \n(It’s a plain gray T-shirt. Do I sound like a stalker?)  \n\n*Option 3: Silence, but with a smile.*  \n(What if he thinks I’m rude?)  \n\nI go with a mumbled, “Hi,” eyes fixed on the lab instructions. My voice sounds alien—too high, too soft. Did he hear me? Should I say it again?  \n\n“Hey,” he says back, and the tightness in my chest eases by half a degree.  \n\n*Okay. Good. Now say something else.*  \n\nI sneak a glance at him. He’s flipping through the textbook, brow furrowed. I love that expression—the way he gets so focused, like the whole world narrows down to one problem. Last month, I watched him explain orbital mechanics to Jacob Kim after school, hands moving in slow arcs to trace planet paths. His voice was so sure. I wanted to melt into the floor.  \n\n*Focus. The project. Say something about the project.*  \n\n“So, um.” I clear my throat. “Should we split the questions?”  \n\n*Too transactional. He’ll think you don’t want to work together.*  \n\n“I mean—unless you want to, like, collaborate on all of them?” *Collaborate?* Who says *collaborate*?  \n\nEthan shrugs. “Either way works.”  \n\n*Neutral response. Does that mean he’s indifferent? Or just flexible?*  \n\nI nod too quickly. “Cool. Let’s just… do them together, then.”  \n\nHe slides the paper between us, and our elbows brush. A jolt shoots up my arm. *Did he notice?* I yank my sleeve over my wrist like it’ll erase the contact.  \n\n*Act normal. You’re normal.*  \n\nThe first question is about chemical bonds. I know the answer. I *always* know the answer. But if I say it too fast, will I sound like a show-off? If I hesitate, will he think I’m dumb?  \n\n“I think it’s covalent,” I say, then immediately second-guess. “Unless—do you think it’s ionic?”  \n\nEthan taps his pencil. “Nah, you’re right. It’s covalent.”  \n\nA tiny victory. *He agrees with me.* I bite my lip to stop a stupid grin.  \n\nWe work through the next few problems, and it’s… okay. Better than okay. He laughs when I make a joke about Mr. Riley’s terrible tie collection (miraculously, my voice didn’t crack), and now I’m floating. This is *working*.  \n\nThen—disaster.  \n\n“You’re really good at this,” he says.  \n\n*Compliment. He gave me a compliment. What do I do what do I do—*  \n\n“Thanks,” I blurt. “I—I like science. It’s predictable. You know, like… reactions follow rules. No surprises.” *Oh my God, why did I say that?*  \n\nEthan tilts his head. “Yeah, I get that. People are way harder to figure out.”  \n\n*Is he talking about me? Does he think I’m hard to figure out?*  \n\nI should say something profound. Something clever. Instead, my mouth betrays me: “Yeah.”  \n\nSilence.  \n\n*Say something else. Anything.*  \n\n“Do you—do you want to work on the presentation part next?”  \n\n“Sure.”  \n\nI pull out my notebook, hands shaking. My doodles from last week stare back—little rockets in the margins, a half-finished sketch of Saturn. *What if he sees? What if he recognizes the planet he was explaining to Jacob?* I snap the cover shut.  \n\nEthan’s watching me. *Stop being weird. Stop being weird.*  \n\n“You draw?” he asks.  \n\n*Abort. Abort.* “Just stupid stuff.”  \n\n“Can I see?”  \n\nPanic floods me. What if he thinks the rockets are about him? (They are, a little.) What if my sketches are bad? (They are, a lot.)  \n\nI flip to a random page—a frog wearing a lab coat. Safe.  \n\nEthan grins. “That’s awesome.”  \n\nRelief. Then immediate terror. *He likes it. Does that mean I should draw more? Should I offer to?*  \n\n“Thanks,” I mutter, slamming the notebook away. *Too eager. Too weird.*  \n\nThe bell rings. Ethan packs up, slinging his bag over one shoulder. “This was fun. We make a good team.”  \n\n*Fun. Good team. Does he mean it?*  \n\n“Yeah,” I say. *Say more!* “Maybe we can, um, work together again sometime.”  \n\n*Too forward. Too obvious.*  \n\nBut Ethan just smiles. “Definitely.”  \n\nHe walks away, and I’m left with my heartbeat pounding in my ears.  \n\n*Did that just happen?*  \n\nI replay every word, every glance, every possible meaning. I should’ve said more. Should’ve been funnier. Should’ve—  \n\n*Stop. He said it was fun.

You’re not here to audit their network.*  \n\nShe’s talking about *Magic: The Gathering*, which is—unexpected. A good unexpected. The kind that makes me forget, for half a second, that I’m reflexively cataloging attack vectors in my head.  \n\n\"I started playing during *Innistrad*,\" she says, tapping her fingers against her glass. \"The gothic horror theme hooked me.\"  \n\n*Innistrad*. 2011. A set rife with graveyard mechanics. I could talk about *Flashback* versus *Undying*, but instead I say, \"That’s a hell of a set to start with. Did you lose your mind over *Snapcaster Mage* like the rest of us?\"  \n\nShe laughs, and it’s a real laugh, not the polite kind people deploy when they’re humoring you. \"Oh my god, yes.

But at least you didn’t sell a *Black Lotus* for gas money in ’94.\"  \n\n\"Did you?\"  \n\n\"No, but I knew a guy.\"  \n\nShe grins, and for a second, it’s easy. Just two nerds talking cardboard crack. No subnets, no firewalls, no social engineering. Just *Magic*.  \n\nThen her phone buzzes.  \n\nShe flips it over, taps the screen, and—  \n\n*Oh no.*  \n\nHer unlock pattern is *L-shaped*. A simple right-angle swipe, three dots down, two across. The kind of pattern you’d use if you *wanted* someone to shoulder-surf it. My fingers twitch. I could replicate that in my sleep.  \n\n*Don’t say anything. Don’t.*  \n\nBut my mouth is already moving. \"You should change that unlock pattern.\"  \n\nHer thumb freezes mid-swipe. \"What?\"  \n\nShit. *Shit.* Too late now. \"It’s—uh. It’s a common pattern. Easy to guess if someone’s watching.\"  \n\nHer expression shifts. Not angry. Not yet. More like *processing*. \"You memorized it just now?\"  \n\n*Yes.* \"No. I mean—it’s a recognizable shape. Basic opsec says to avoid geometric—\"  \n\n\"You’re *hacking* me on a first date?\"  \n\n\"I’m not—\" I exhale. \"I’m not hacking you. It’s just… reflexive.\"  \n\n\"Reflexive.\"  \n\n\"Yeah. Like… noticing fire exits in a building. Or weak passwords on a login screen.\"  \n\nShe sets her phone down carefully. \"So you just… see vulnerabilities everywhere?\"  \n\n*Yes.* \"Mostly.\"  \n\nA beat. Then, unexpectedly, she snorts. \"That sounds exhausting.\"  \n\nI blink. \"It is.\"  \n\nShe tilts her head. \"Is that why you went white hat? Because you couldn’t *not* see the cracks?\"  \n\nI stare at her. Most people don’t ask that. Most people hear \"reformed hacker\" and either get weirdly excited (*\"Oh, like Mr. Robot?\"*) or nervous (*\"So you could, like, steal my identity right now?\"*). But she’s just… curious.  \n\n\"Yeah,\" I admit. \"It was either get paid to fix things or go insane.\"  \n\nShe nods, then picks up her phone. \"So what’s a better pattern, then?\"  \n\nI hesitate. \"You’re not mad?\"  \n\n\"I mean, it’s a little creepy,\" she says lightly. \"But also useful? If I’m gonna get robbed, I’d rather it not be because my unlock pattern was *literally an L*.\"  \n\nRelief floods me. \"Okay. So, longer swipe. More turns. Or better yet, use a PIN.\"  \n\nShe taps at her screen. \"Like this?\" She shows me—a zigzag, five points.  \n\n\"Better.

Bad? Does he think I’m a try-hard?*  \n\n“I—just wanted to make sure we had enough.” *Too defensive. Sound normal.* “I mean, it’s not that much. Just bullet points, really.”  \n\nHe squints at my meticulously color-coded list. “Bullet points with sub-bullets.”  \n\n*He’s teasing me. Is that good? Bad?* My face burns. “I like organizing things.”  \n\n*Lame. So lame.*  \n\nBut Jamie just shrugs. “Cool. I’m more of a last-minute guy.”  \n\n*Opposites attract, right? Wait—NO. Don’t think that. This is a science project, not a rom-com.*  \n\nI force myself to look at him. “So, um, should we start the experiment?”  \n\n“Yeah, let’s do it.” He grabs the lab sheet and starts reading off the steps. His voice is warm and easy, like he’s never once worried about how his words come out.  \n\n*How does he do that? Just… talk? Without rehearsing every sentence three times in his head first?*  \n\nI watch his hands as he measures the liquid into the beaker. They’re steady. Mine shake when I’m nervous. Right now, they’re practically vibrating.  \n\n*Don’t spill anything. Don’t knock anything over. Don’t be a disaster.*  \n\n“You wanna pour this in?” Jamie holds out the beaker.  \n\n*He’s trusting me with the experiment. This is a good sign. Unless he’s just being polite. Or worse—what if he’s letting me do it because he thinks I’ll freak out if he says no?*  \n\nI take it carefully, our fingers brushing. A tiny electric jolt shoots up my arm. *Did he feel that too? No, of course not. Get a grip.*  \n\nThe liquid sloshes as I pour. Too fast. A drop splashes onto the table.  \n\n*Idiot. Clumsy idiot.*  \n\n“Nice save,” Jamie says, dabbing at the spill with a paper towel.  \n\n*Was that sarcasm? No, his smile looks genuine. But what if—*  \n\n“Thanks,” I mumble. *Say something else. Keep the conversation going.* “So, um… do you like science?”  \n\n*DO I LIKE SCIENCE? That’s the best you’ve got?*  \n\nJamie tilts his head. “Kinda. I’m better at math, though.”  \n\n*Math. Okay. I can work with that.* “Me too. I mean, I like math. Not that I’m *good* at it—” *Stop undermining yourself!* “I mean, I’m okay at it.”  \n\n*Wow. Riveting stuff.*  \n\nJamie grins. “You’re, like, the smartest person in our grade. You don’t have to pretend you’re bad at stuff.”  \n\n*Wait. What?*  \n\nMy brain screeches to a halt. *He thinks I’m smart? He’s noticed me?*  \n\n*No—maybe he’s just being nice. Or worse, maybe he’s heard other people say it and he’s just repeating it. Or—*  \n\n“I’m serious,” he adds. “You always know the answers in class.”  \n\n*He’s paid attention. To me.*  \n\nI stare at the beaker like it holds the secrets of the universe. “I just… study a lot.”  \n\n*BORING. SAY SOMETHING INTERESTING.*  \n\n“It’s kinda nerdy, I guess.” *Why did I say that? Now he’ll think I’m insecure.*  \n\nBut Jamie just laughs. “Nerdy’s cool.”  \n\n*Did he just call me cool? No. He said nerdy is cool. Not me. Unless…?*  \n\nThe bell rings. I jump like I’ve been electrocuted.  \n\n*No! We were finally talking!*  \n\nJamie starts packing up. “This was fun. We should work together again.”  \n\n*Fun. He said fun. He wants to work together again. DOES THAT MEAN ANYTHING?*  \n\n“Yeah,” I say, nodding way too much. “Totally.”  \n\n*“Totally”? Who says “totally”?*  \n\nHe slings his backpack over his shoulder. “See you tomorrow, Lucy.”  \n\n*HE REMEMBERED MY NAME. HE KNOWS MY NAME.*  \n\n“See you,” I squeak.  \n\nAs he walks away, my brain replays every second of the last twenty minutes, analyzing every word, every glance.  \n\n*Did I sound stupid? Was I too quiet? Too awkward?*  \n\nBut then I remember the way he smiled when he called me smart.  \n\n*Maybe… just maybe… it was okay.*  \n\nI press my notebook to my chest again, hiding my own stupid grin.","thinking_enabled":false,"thinking_content":null,"thinking_elapsed_secs":null,"ban_edit":false,"ban_regenerate":false,"status":"FINISHED","accumulated_token_usage":1634,"files":[],"tips":[],"inserted_at":1747847058.995721,"search_enabled":false,"search_status":null,"search_results":null},{"message_id":9,"parent_id":8,"model":"","role":"USER","content":"Nettle (or Nets to her friends) bartends at The Last Outpost -- a lazy hub for miners and merchants in an asteroid belt on the Andromeda outer rim.

Bribe her with a drink, and she might bump you up the list.\"  \n\nHarkin huffs but doesn’t argue. He knows I’m right.  \n\nThen the door hisses open, and the room’s rhythm stutters.  \n\nA stranger. Not unusual—Outpost gets drifters all the time—but this one’s got the look of someone running *from* rather than *to*. Tentacled dreads, usually sleek among their kind, are frayed at the ends like they’ve been yanked at in frustration. Their four eyes dart across the room before landing on me.  \n\nThey slide onto a barstool.  \n\n\"Vega whisky. Neat.\" A pause. \"Better make that a double.\"  \n\nVoice rough, like they’ve been screaming or not talking for days. Either way, trouble.  \n\nI grab a glass. \"Rough shift?\"  \n\nThey bark a laugh—sharp, humorless. \"You could say that.\"  \n\nI pour the whisky, slide it over. They knock it back in one go and tap the glass for another.  \n\n*Oh yeah. Trouble.*  \n\nI refill it but don’t let go this time. \"You got a name?\"  \n\nThey blink—all four eyelids in quick succession. \"Zeke.\"  \n\n\"Zeke.\" I test the name. \"You mining? Trading?\"  \n\n\"Neither.\"  \n\nI raise an eyebrow.  \n\nZeke exhales, claws tapping the counter. \"Let’s just say I’m between employers.\"  \n\nThat gets my attention. \"You’re not Guild, are you?\"  \n\nA flicker in their top-right eye. \"Not anymore.\"  \n\n*Kriff.* Guild means contracts. Guild means *hunters*. And \"not anymore\" means either fired or fugitive.  \n\nI glance at the door. No one’s followed them in. Yet.  \n\n\"Look,\" I say, leaning in, voice low. \"I don’t care what you’re running from, but if it’s gonna bring heat to my bar, I need to know.\"  \n\nZeke’s tentacles coil tight. \"It won’t. I just need a place to lay low for a cycle or two.\"  \n\nBefore I can answer, the door hisses again.  \n\nThree figures. Guild insignias on their jackets.  \n\nZeke goes rigid.  \n\nThe leader—a broad-shouldered human with a scar across his nose—scans the room. Stops at the bar.  \n\n*Kriff kriff kriff.*  \n\n\"Evening,\" Scar says, too cheerful. \"Heard we might find someone here. Goes by Zeke?\"  \n\nI keep my face blank. \"Lots of people come through here.\"  \n\nScar’s smile doesn’t reach his eyes. \"This one’s got a bounty. Guild business.\"  \n\nOut of the corner of my eye, Zeke’s claws dig into the counter.  \n\nI cross my arms. \"Last Outpost’s neutral ground. You know the rules.\"  \n\nScar’s grin fades. \"Rules don’t apply to deserters.\"  \n\nZeke’s voice is a hiss. \"I didn’t desert. I *quit*.\"  \n\nScar’s hand drifts toward his holster. \"Semantics.\"  \n\nThe room’s gone quiet. Even Harkin’s stopped grumbling.  \n\nI step between them, palms up. \"Take it outside. No fights in here.\"  \n\nScar tilts his head. \"You protecting him, barkeep?\"  \n\n\"I’m protecting my bar.\"  \n\nA beat. Then Scar chuckles. \"Fine. We’ll wait.\" He jerks his chin at his crew, and they slink to a corner booth, eyes locked on Zeke.  \n\nZeke’s breathing is ragged. \"I can’t—they’ll—\"  \n\nI grab a bottle and pour two shots. \"Drink.\"  \n\nThey obey.  \n\nI lean in. \"What did you do?\"  \n\nZeke’s voice drops to a whisper. \"I saw something I wasn’t supposed to. Guild’s got a contract—whole colony on Lyra-3. They’re not evacuating. They’re *erasing*.\"  \n\nIce slithers down my spine. \"Why?\"  \n\n\"Don’t know. But I wasn’t sticking around to find out.\"  \n\nI exhale. *Kriffing hell.*  \n\nZeke grips my wrist. \"I just need a ship. Any ship. I can pay.\"  \n\nI glance at Scar’s table. They’re watching. Waiting.  \n\n\"You got any friends here?\" I ask.  \n\nZeke’s shoulders slump. \"No.\"  \n\n*Of course not.*  \n\nI rub my temples. \"I know a guy. Freighter pilot. Doesn’t ask questions.\"  \n\nZeke’s eyes widen. \"You’d do that?\"  \n\n\"I’m not doing anything.\" I pull out my comm, type a quick message. \"But if you happen to be at docking bay seven in an hour, well. Coincidences happen.\"  \n\nZeke’s tentacles loosen. \"Thank you.\"  \n\n\"Don’t thank me yet.\" I nod toward the door. \"You gotta get out of here first.\"  \n\nAs if on cue, Scar stands.  \n\nZeke tenses.  \n\nI grab a dishrag, toss it at them. \"Back hall. Now.\"  \n\nThey don’t argue.  \n\nScar’s at the bar before Zeke’s even gone. \"Where’d he go?\"  \n\nI shrug. \"Bathroom?\"  \n\nScar’s eyes narrow. \"You’re a terrible liar.\"  \n\nI smirk. \"And you’re a terrible tipper.\"  \n\nHis hand snaps out, grabs my collar. \"Listen here, you—\"  \n\nThe click of a safety disengaging cuts him off.  \n\nMira’s voice, lazy and lethal from behind him: \"You’re wrinkling her shirt, big guy.\"  \n\nScar freezes. Lets go.  \n\nI straighten my collar. \"Thanks, Mira.\"  \n\nShe grins, her plasma pistol still leveled at Scar’s back. \"Anytime.\"  \n\nScar glares. \"This isn’t over.\"  \n\nI pour myself a shot. \"It never is.\"  \n\nHe storms out, his lackeys trailing.  \n\nMira holsters her gun. \"You’re gonna get yourself killed one of these days.\"  \n\nI knock back the whisky. \"Probably.\"  \n\nShe eyes me. \"So. Who’s the tentacle-head?\"  \n\nI sigh. \"Trouble.\"  \n\nMira laughs. \"Aren’t they all?\"  \n\nOutside, the Outpost’s neon sign flickers. Somewhere in the docking bays, Zeke’s running.  \n\nAnd somewhere out there, the Guild’s waiting.  \n\nI pour another drink.  \n\nTonight’s gonna be *long*.","thinking_enabled":false,"thinking_content":null,"thinking_elapsed_secs":null,"ban_edit":false,"ban_regenerate":false,"status":"FINISHED","accumulated_token_usage":3454,"files":[],"tips":[],"inserted_at":1747847170.460918,"search_enabled":false,"search_status":null,"search_results":null},{"message_id":11,"parent_id":9,"model":"","role":"ASSISTANT","content":"**The Last Outpost**  \n\nThe hum of the Outpost’s aging climate regulator is a steady companion behind the clink of glasses and the low murmur of miners swapping lies. I’m polishing a tumbler—more out of habit than necessity—when the door hisses open.  \n\nA stranger.  \n\nNot unusual. But the way they move—jerky, like their bones don’t fit right—catches my eye. Tentacled dreads, usually sleek and coiled tight in zero-g, are frayed at the ends, floating slightly in the Outpost’s artificial gravity like they’ve been yanked at one too many times. Their eyes dart across the room before landing on me.  \n\n*Trouble.*  \n\nThey slide onto a barstool with the grace of someone who’s been running. \"Vega whisky. Neat. Better make that a double.\"  \n\nI raise an eyebrow but don’t comment. Just grab the good stuff—the real Vega, not the synth-piss most places peddle out here. Pour it heavy. Slide it over.  \n\nThey knock it back in one go. Wince. Then finally look at me properly.  \n\n\"Thanks.\" Their voice is rough, like they’ve been breathing recycled air too long.  \n\nI lean on the bar. \"Rough shift?\"  \n\nA dry laugh. \"You could say that.\"  \n\n*Vague. Annoying.* I tilt my head. \"Mining rig or merchant?\"  \n\n\"Neither.\" They tap the glass. \"Another.\"  \n\n*Definitely trouble.*  \n\nI pour. \"You got a name, or should I just call you ‘double Vega’ all night?\"  \n\nTheir lips twitch. \"Kess.\"  \n\n\"Nets.\" I nod toward the rest of the Outpost. \"Welcome to the last place anyone wants to be.\"  \n\nKess exhales, shoulders loosening just a fraction. \"Seems alright to me.\"  \n\nBefore I can answer, the door hisses again. Three miners from the *Iron Belly* crew stomp in, laughing too loud, already half in the bag. One of them—Rourke, a walking liability—spots Kess and stiffens.  \n\n*Oh, hell.*  \n\nRourke’s grin turns sharp. \"Well, look who it is.\"  \n\nKess doesn’t turn. Just takes a slow sip.  \n\nI flick a glance between them. \"Problem?\"  \n\nRourke swaggers up to the bar. \"No problem. Just didn’t expect to see *this one* here.\" He leans in, breath reeking of synth-gin. \"Thought you’d be halfway to the Belt by now, *freelancer*.\"  \n\nKess’s fingers tighten around the glass. \"Changed my mind.\"  \n\nRourke snorts. \"Or got *caught*.\"  \n\nThe other miners chuckle, but there’s an edge to it.  \n\nI clear my throat. \"Rourke. You’re blocking the bar.\"  \n\nHe ignores me, eyes locked on Kess. \"You know what happens to freelancers who skip out on deals, right?\"  \n\nKess finally turns. \"I don’t recall skipping anything.\"  \n\n\"Bullshit.\" Rourke slams a hand on the counter. \"You were supposed to deliver. We paid up front.\"  \n\n*Ah.* So *that’s* the kind of trouble we’re dealing with.  \n\nI cross my arms. \"Take it outside, Rourke.\"  \n\nHe glares at me. \"This ain’t your business, Nets.\"  \n\n\"It is when you’re scaring off my other customers.\" I nod toward a table of merchants eyeing the scene with clear discomfort.  \n\nKess stands abruptly. \"I’ll go.\"  \n\nRourke grabs their arm. \"Oh no you don’t—\"  \n\n*Bad move.*  \n\nKess moves faster than I expect. A twist, a shift, and Rourke’s grip is broken, his wrist bent just shy of snapping. He yelps.  \n\nThe Outpost goes quiet.  \n\nKess doesn’t let go. Just leans in, voice low. \"I said I didn’t skip. Your boss got what he paid for. If he’s pissed, that’s between him and the *real* problem.\"  \n\nRourke’s face darkens. \"You’re dead, freelancer.\"  \n\nKess releases him. \"Maybe. But not tonight.\"  \n\nThey drop a handful of credits on the bar—more than the drinks cost—and head for the door.  \n\nRourke snarls, but his buddies hold him back. \"This ain’t over!\"  \n\nThe door seals shut behind Kess.  \n\nI exhale. \"Anyone else need a drink, or are we done with the theatrics?\"  \n\nThe miners grumble but slink off to a corner table. The merchants relax. The hum of conversation starts up again, louder now, buzzing with fresh gossip.  \n\n*Great. Just what I needed.*  \n\nI scoop up Kess’s credits. Then pause.  \n\nUnderneath the chips is a slip of paper. Frayed at the edges.  \n\nI unfold it.  \n\n*\"They’re watching the Outpost. Be careful.\"*  \n\nI stare at the words.
